## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
Learned a bit more about CSS positionings- differences between absolute, relative, fixed and sticky and more particularly how relative and absolute work together.
Learnt more about the background property as well, how you can add multiple background properties to make one flowing background
Also made use of the z-index property for the first time.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image: url(/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-master/images/bg-curvy-desktop.svg),
    linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(217, 28%, 15%), hsl(218, 28%, 13%));
}
```

### Continued development
In the future, will focus on responsiveness, how to use media queries in relation with grid and flexbox to make responsive websites.
